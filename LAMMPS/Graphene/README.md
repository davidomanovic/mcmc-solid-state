# Free-standing Monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC)
Physics project II - EPFL
Method to synthesize large-area, free‐standing monolayers of amorphous carbon using kinetic Monte Carlo and force-fields. Unlike graphene, the resulting material has an amorphous structure composed of a mix of five-, six-, seven-, and eight-membered carbon rings. Detailed atomic-resolution imaging (using TEM), along with Raman and XPS spectroscopy, confirms that this monolayer lacks long-range periodicity and instead exhibits a network that includes nanometre-sized crystallites embedded within a continuous random network. We can explore its mechanical properties, demonstrating high breaking strength and plastic deformation under force—and its insulating electrical properties. Measured bandgap is approximately 2.1 eV. These unique properties suggest potential applications in areas such as flexible electronics, magnetic recording, and diffusion barriers for advanced devices.
